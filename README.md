# steamos-nvidia-installer

**Install real SteamOS on any PC with an NVIDIA RTX graphics card.**

Valve's SteamOS recovery image only ships drivers for AMD hardware. This
script takes the official recovery image and produces a bootable USB
installer with the NVIDIA driver baked in — including self-healing OS
updates, so updating from inside Steam keeps working afterwards.

Everything is built from the official image on your own machine. Nothing
from Valve is redistributed here.

## What you need

**A Linux machine to build the USB image on** (Arch-based recommended):

- ~20 GB free disk space
- `losetup`, `btrfs-progs`, `rsync`, `curl`, `kmod`, `zstd`, `pacman`,
  `python3`, `binutils` (for `readelf`)
- root (`sudo`)

**The target machine** (where SteamOS will be installed):

- NVIDIA **RTX 20-series or newer** — the open kernel driver only supports
  Turing and later, so GTX cards will **not** work **in the default (open)
  mode**. Pass `--proprietary` to build with the proprietary `nvidia-dkms`
  driver instead, which supports **Pascal (GTX 10-series, e.g. a GTX 1050)**
  and newer. See "Pascal / GTX 10xx support" below.
- UEFI boot, **Secure Boot disabled**
- A USB stick or external drive of **16 GB or more** to flash the installer to

## Step 0 — Get this script

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/28allday/steamos-nvidia-installer.git
cd steamos-nvidia-installer
```

Or download just the one script:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/28allday/steamos-nvidia-installer/main/steamos-nvidia-installer.sh
chmod +x steamos-nvidia-installer.sh
```

## Step 1 — Download the official SteamOS recovery image

Get it straight from Valve:

**https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227#install**

Download the recovery image and decompress it — you end up with a `.img` file:

```bash
bunzip2 steamdeck-*.img.bz2
```

## Step 2 — Build the NVIDIA installer image

Put the `.img` next to the script and run it (with no argument it
auto-detects a single recovery image sitting beside it):

```bash
sudo ./steamos-nvidia-installer.sh steamdeck-<version>.img
```

This copies the image (**the original is never modified**), resolves the
current NVIDIA open driver from Arch Linux, pins it to permanent archive
URLs, verifies every binary is compatible with the image's glibc, compiles
the kernel module against the image's exact kernel in a throwaway build
chroot, installs the driver, and adds a one-click installer to the desktop.
Takes roughly 10–20 minutes. The result is:

```
steamdeck-<version>-nvidia-usbinstall.img
```

## Step 3 — Flash it to USB

```bash
sudo dd if=steamdeck-<version>-nvidia-usbinstall.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB stick (check with `lsblk` — **everything on
it will be erased**).

## Step 4 — Boot the USB and install

1. Boot the target machine from the USB stick (UEFI boot menu, Secure Boot off).
2. It boots into a SteamOS desktop. Double-click one of the icons:
   - **Install SteamOS (NVIDIA) to Hard Drive** — fresh install; erases the
     chosen disk completely.
   - **Upgrade SteamOS (NVIDIA) — keeps games & data** — reinstalls only the
     OS partitions on a disk that already has SteamOS, preserving your games,
     saves and Steam login.
3. Pick the target disk, confirm, and wait a few minutes. The machine powers
   off when done.
4. Remove the USB stick and boot. First boot lands in the Steam setup
   screen, then it's a normal SteamOS machine — Game Mode, Desktop Mode,
   the lot.

## OS updates

Updates from inside Steam **just work** (this is the default). Valve's
updater stages the new OS version as usual, then the driver is
automatically rebuilt for the new version before the reboot prompt appears
(adds 10–20 minutes to an update). If the rebuild fails for any reason,
the update is cancelled and the machine keeps booting the current working
system — it fails safe.

To move to a **newer driver** later, rebuild the USB image with an updated
copy of this script (it re-resolves the latest driver each run) and
reinstall using the **Upgrade** icon.

Alternative update modes at build time:

| Flag | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | Self-healing updates as described above |
| `--hold-updates` | Steam always reports "up to date" — OS is frozen |
| `--no-hold-updates` | Stock updates — **an OS update will remove the driver** |

## All options

```
--hold-updates     Hard-hold OS updates instead of self-healing.
--no-hold-updates  Stock update behaviour (driver lost on update!).
--proprietary      Use the proprietary nvidia-dkms driver (Pascal/GTX 10xx+).
--no-installer     Skip the desktop installer — just a bootable patched OS.
--trim-cuda        Drop CUDA/OpenCL/OptiX libraries (~350 MB smaller).
--skip-sigcheck    Disable pacman signature checks in the build chroot.
--workdir DIR      Build cache location (~3 GB, speeds up reruns).
```

## Pascal / GTX 10xx support (GTX 1050, etc.)

The upstream script only builds the **open** kernel module (`nvidia-open-dkms`),
which supports Turing (RTX 20-series) and newer. Cards like the **GTX 1050**
(Pascal, 2016) are *not* supported by `nvidia-open`.

This fork adds a `--proprietary` flag that swaps in the **proprietary**
`nvidia-dkms` driver (which *does* support Pascal). Everything else — the
glibc compatibility scan, self-healing updates, one-click installer — works
identically; the on-device `repatch.sh` pins the same proprietary packages so
future OS updates keep rebuilding the working driver.

```bash
sudo ./steamos-nvidia-installer.sh --proprietary steamdeck-<version>.img
```

Caveats specific to proprietary mode:

- The proprietary module for Pascal normally runs in **native (non-GSP)** mode,
  so the GSP-firmware warning from the open driver does not apply.
- You still need **UEFI + Secure Boot off**.
- Tested logic, but **not** run on real SteamOS hardware in this fork — verify
  on your own GTX-1050 machine.

## Troubleshooting

**Black screen on first boot of the installed system** — power-cycle once
before digging deeper; SteamOS hides its boot console (it lives on tty4–6),
so a working boot can look black for a while. If it persists, press
`Ctrl+Alt+F3`, log in as `deck`, and run `steamos-session-select plasma`
to get a desktop for diagnosis.

**The build says "No repair_device.sh in image home"** — the `.img` you
fed it isn't the recovery/repair image. Use the recovery image from the
link in Step 1.

**pacman signature errors during the build** — rerun with
`--skip-sigcheck` (packages come from Valve's and Arch's own servers over
HTTPS).

**Hybrid graphics laptops (iGPU + RTX)** — desktops with only an RTX card
are the clean path. On hybrids the iGPU may own the boot display; results
vary.

## Security note

The installed system ships a passwordless-sudo drop-in for the `deck` user
(the desktop installer needs it). Once you've set a password
(`passwd` in Desktop Mode), remove it:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/zz-deck-nopasswd
```
